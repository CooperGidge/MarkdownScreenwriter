# Fade in:

## EXT. Skyscraper - day

WE OPEN with a shot climbing the edge of a tall skyscraper, slowly panning upwards as the sun lights up one half of the building, leaving the other in darkness.

# Cut to:

## INT. Skyscraper - CEO's office - day

The camera shows the back silhouette, illuminated by a computer screen, of a man in a chair with steaming coffee to his right and a stack of paperwork to his left. The light of the computer screen infront of the man is pure white and makes everything else dark. The man is wearing a headset with a microphone.

#### {{ characters.protagonist }}

##### (into headset)

> Hold your horses there, {{ characters.sidekick_lastname }}. We still have other options.

The camera slowly zooms onto the man, dimming the light and revealling an online group call on the computer screen, {{ characters.sidekick }} among the call members.

### Intercut Behind computer monitor

Camera shows back of computer monitor, dark, and the man's front, fully illuminated, with everything else dark.

#### {{ characters.sidekick }} (V.O)

> I'm just saying, if it comes to it, you have to be ready to do what needs to be done.

# Cut to:

## INT. Mansion - home office - day

Camera and lighting is same as previous scene left on, just in {{ characters.sidekick }}'s home office.

#### {{ characters.sidekick }} (CONT'D)

##### (into headset)

> Do you think you can do that, {{ characters.protagonist_lastname }}?

### Intercut {{ characters.sidekick }}'s computer screen

The screen is bright, everything else dark. {{ characters.protagonist }} is on the screen, sighs, and says:

#### {{ characters.protagonist }}

##### (into headset)

> Yes.

{{ characters.protagonist }} nods.
